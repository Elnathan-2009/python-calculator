# ðŸ§® Python Calculator

This is my very first project in Python â€” a simple calculator that can perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## ðŸŒ± My Journey

I am new to programming, and this is the very first time Iâ€™ve built something that actually works. At first, I didnâ€™t know how to start, but I kept learning step by step.  
Building this calculator has been an amazing experience â€” I learned how to take user input, use conditionals, and make my code run in a loop so it can calculate multiple times.  

This project might look simple, but to me, it represents the **beginning of my coding journey**. Iâ€™m proud of this small step, because it shows me that I can build things with code.
